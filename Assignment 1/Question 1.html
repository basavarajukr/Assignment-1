            // question1
            console.log(1 + "2" + "2");
            // output : 122
            // reason : single arithmetic operator(+) just concatinates the variables.
            
            console.log(1 +  +"2" + "2");
            // output : 32
            // reason : Two arithmetic operators(++) perform the addition.
            //          Here 1+2=3 and 2 is simply concatinated.
            //          Here string is taken as number(if the value of string is number) when 2 arithmetic operators are used.

            console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
            // output : 02
            // reason : Two arithmetic operators(+-) perform the subtraction.
            //          Here 1-1=0 and 2 is simply concatinated.
            //          Here string is taken as number(if the value of string is number) when 2 arithmetic operators are used.

            console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");
            // output : 112
            // reason : Here the arithmetic operator just concatinated all the variables
            //          If there is no variable to concatinate it just neglects the arithmetic operator.

            console.log("A" - "B" + "2");
            // output : NaN2
            // reason : Here the value first 2 strings is not a number hence they are not defined(NaN) 
            //          and the third string is a number(2) hence it is concatinated with NaN as NaN2.

            console.log("A" - "B" + 2);
            // output : NaN
            // reason : Here the value first 2 strings is not a number hence they are not defined(NaN)
            //          and the number cannot be concatinated with not defined unless it is written in
            //          inside string.
